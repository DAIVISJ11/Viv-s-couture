        Fashion designers are responsible for conceptualizing and creating clothing, accessories, and footwear. They draw inspiration from various sources, including art, culture, and current trends, to develop unique designs. The process typically involves sketching initial ideas, selecting fabrics, and creating prototypes. Designers often use computer-aided design (CAD) programs to visualize their concepts digitally, allowing for easier adjustments before final production.
